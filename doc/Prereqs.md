## Course Description and Prerequisites

Existing and emerging statistical techniques and their application to astronomical surveys and cosmological data analysis. Topics covered will include statistical frameworks (Bayesian inference and frequentist statistics), numerical methods including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and machine learning applied to classification and regression. Hands on activities based on open-source software in python.

The course is aimed at graduate students intending to do research in
astrophysics and cosomology.  The level will be aimed at first and
second year students, but more advanced students are welcome.

However, we aim to make the course accessible and relevant to first year graduate students intending to work in astrophysics and comsology, even if they do not have extensive experience in these fields.  

Basic familiarity with Python coding (or willingness to learn quickly!), and basic statistics at the level of [STATS 116](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=STATS+116%3A+Theory+of+Probability&collapse=) (Old notes available [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/courses/s116/).) are expected.
