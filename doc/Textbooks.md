This course will be mostly self-contained, but it's good to read around the subject (and you might find clues to some of the exercises while you're at it). We recommend the following textbooks to accompany this course:

* **[Ivezic et al “Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy”](http://www.astroml.org/)**

> This is a very useful "cookbook," providing easy-to-follow recipes in astronomical data analysis and good, clear explanations. The library has a few copies that you can borrow, as do the course teachers - but it's
also a [good one to invest in](http://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Mining-Machine-Learning-Astronomy/dp/0691151687).

* **[MacKay “Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms”](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itprnn/book.html)**

> This book goes way beyond the scope of PHYS366, but it's
introduction to Bayesian inference is excellent, and it's free to
download from the above website. You can also click through to an
online bookseller from there to order a hard copy. Page X of the
Preface  lists the chapters relating to inference: we will focus on
chapters 2,3,20,21,22,24,27,28,29 and 30.


Other good books to check out:

* **Gelman et al “Bayesian Data Analysis”**

> Should be available from the library, or [for online purchase here](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439840954/).
