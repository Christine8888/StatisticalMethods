The course is aimed at graduate students\r\nintending to do research in astrophysics and cosmology, and we\r\nstrongly encourage most first and second year students working in\r\nKIPAC to take the course.  Our goal is to provide a background that\r\nwill be directly relevant to the kind of problems that typical KIPAC\r\nstudents will encounter in their research.\r\n\r\n### Preliminaries\r\n\r\n* [Prerequisites](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/Prereqs.md)\r\n* [Schedule](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/Schedule.md)\r\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/GettingStarted.md)\r\n* [Textbooks and Course Materials](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/Textbooks.md)\r\n* [Course Requirements](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/Requirements.md)\r\n* [Homework](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/Homework.md)\r\n\r\n### Lessons\r\n\r\n* Exploring Data\r\n* Understanding from Data\r\n* Inference in Practice: PDF Characterization\r\n* Inference in Practice: Sampling Techniques\r\n* Inference in Practice: Coping with Complications \r\n* Inference in Practice: Evaluating Models\r\n* Applications in Astroparticle Physics\r\n* Applications in Cosmology\r\n* Machine Learning\r\n* Project Presenations\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\n* Phil Marshall\r\n* Risa Wechsler\r\n\r\nAll materials Copyright 2015 Phil Marshall, Adam Mantz, Elisabeth Krause, and Risa Wechsler, and distributed for copying and extension under the GPLv2 License.
