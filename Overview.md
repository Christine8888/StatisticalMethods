## Course Overview

 (Under development, comments welcome [here](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/issues/2)!)

Existing and emerging statistical techniques and their application to astronomical surveys and cosmological data analysis. Topics covered will include statistical frameworks (Bayesian inference and frequentist statistics), numerical methods including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and machine learning applied to classification and regression.
Hands on activities based on open-source software in python.
