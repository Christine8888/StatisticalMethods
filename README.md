# Materials for the LSSTC DSFP (September 2019)

These lectures have been adapted from the Stanford University course *PHYS366: Special Topics in Astrophysics: Statistical Methods* (Spring 2019 version). You can find that entire course [here](https://github.com/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods).

Please note that while the lecture notes can be viewed on the web, you will need to clone or download this repository branch and open them on your local machine in order to interact with them or run code.
